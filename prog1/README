Test programs - batch-1

Instructions:

  Copy/download ALL of the files in this directory into your 
own directory containing your implementation of List.h.
(Including the weird looking _util.h and _test.h files).

  There are five auto-scoring tester programs in this 
batch.  The source files are listed below.

    t1_eq_to.cpp
    t2_count.cpp
    t3_len.cpp
    t4_pop_back.cpp
    t5_prefix.cpp

To compile the test programs you can simply type make from 
the shell.

You can also compile them directly one-by-one.

Be sure to use -std=c++11   !!!

When you run a test program, you will get a report for
all of the individual tests that were run including points
assigned.  (Unless the program crashes, then you
might only get the output before the crash).

Each test has a short description so you have some idea
of the scenario being tested (details can be seen by examining
the test programs themselves).
